# Hackmate üéØ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: Hackmate Dev Team

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Adwaith Jayasankar - Sahrdaya College of Engineering & Technology

### Project Description
Hackmate is a platform aimed at college students and hackathon enthusiasts who want to find teammates based on specific skills. It helps users search, connect, and chat with potential teammates in real-time.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Finding teammates with the exact skills you need at a hackathon is always time-consuming. Why waste time when you can just "Hackmate" it?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Hackmate makes it easy to search for and chat with teammates. Built with a powerful, real-time search system and Firebase-powered chat, you‚Äôll find the right match for your project in minutes!
